This includes the paper review, slides, and datasets (should be uploaded seperately as they are pretty large).
[So the data sets are too large for me to add onto blackboard, the websites to download them are:

ucf101:
http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php
hdmb51: 
http://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/hmdb-a-large-human-motion-database/#Downloads

The code for MPCCA and PCCA are provided in paper code; however, 
these aren't the full representation of MVSV and I couldn't find the
implementation for it.

Have a great break.
